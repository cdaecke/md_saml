# Attention
# If the website uses a mixed setup consisting of a TypoScript template (sys_template) and site sets,
# it is important to uncheck the "Clear" flag for constants and setup in the TypoScript template.
# If the "Clear" flag is checked (default), TypoScript settings from site sets are cleared and
# do therefore not apply.
